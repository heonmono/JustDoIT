Weekly Objectives

    This week, we briefly learn the concept and the application of computer simulations
    Introduction purpose
    Objectives are
    Understanding the concepts of modeling and simulation
'''
'''
How to comprehend a problem?
    The way to comprehend a given program
    Estimate the outputs of a given input
    Estimate the progress of the program in the system
    Just as we traced the function calls of the recursion in the execution timeline
    How to comprehend a problem?
    Estimate the future of a given status-quo
    Estimate the progress of problem factors in the system
    However, the real-world problem is not a program in a well-defined programming language

# Chapter 5 - 1 Introduction of modeling

'''
Models and why modeling?
    Since, it is difficult to trace the real-world problems.
    We create a model that simplifies the real-world problems
    The model is a simplification of the real world problems.
    The model is an essence of the real world problems.

Two Types of Models
    Models to solve
        Numerical modeling - regression with formula
        Linear programming, Integer programming
        Goal: converting the real world problems into formula, then finding optimal solutions through solvers
    Models to simulate
        System dynamics, discrete event models, agent based models
        Event graphs, petri-net, agent modeling
        Goal: approximating to the real world problems, then finding the optimal solutions through repetitive simulations
